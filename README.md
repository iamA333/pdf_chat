# PDF Summarizer Web App
The PDF Summarizer is a Python web application that allows users to upload PDF files and generate a summary of the content within those PDF documents and also answer questions based on the PDF. This tool utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract the most important information from the uploaded PDF files. The project reads the file, identifies the text, converts it to tokens and then embeddings which will be selected based on the query and then passed to an LLM (CTransformers)

## Features

Summarization: The application processes the uploaded PDF and generates a concise summary of the document's content.

Question Answering: The application processes the uploaded PDF and answers questions based on it
